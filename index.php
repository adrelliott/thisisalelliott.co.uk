        <p class="lead mb-5">I’m a proper marketing nerd. <br>I created my first website back in 2002, and I was instantly hooked on all things digital. I’ve written some books on marketing (the first few are cringey), started plenty of businesses (with my fair share of failures) and now I spend my days running multiple companies and doing private consulting for progressive companies who are as obsessed with results as I am.</p>
