        <p class="lead mb-5">I’m one of those ‘curious entrepreneurs’ which means I like to learn new skills regularly. Here’s a list of the top skills I’m most proud of:</p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">WordPress Development</h3>
            <p class="lead "> I love creating new websites, and for most projects, WordPress is a great choice. With an intuitive dashboard and almost unlimited plugins, content creators just love it.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Web Development (PHP)</h3>
            <p class="lead "> When WordPress doesn't cut it, I reach for my favourite PHP framework, Laravel. It's an intuitive, yet powerful PHP framework, that makes developing web applications an absolute joy. (I couple this with the CSS framework Bootstrap - or sometimes Bulma -  and recently have been dabbling in Vue.js)</p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Email Marketing</h3>
            <p class="lead ">I’ve been creating email campaigns since 2004, and although I’ve used most of the major platforms out there (Mailchimp, Drip, Infusionsoft etc), my go-to these days is the amazing Active Campaign. Course, an ESP (Email Service Provide) is only as good as the emails you send, so...</p>

            <p class="lead ">There’s no point sending an email if it doesn’t encourage an action. I’ve been honing my storytelling skills for years, and that helps me write emails, landing pages, websites and adverts that get results.</p>

            <p class="lead ">People, think Facebook is complicated, but it’s actually really simple. Just say the right thing, to the right person at the right time. Couple that with an almost obsessive knowledge of conversion-first marketing, and I can craft campaigns that get you the results you want, for the budget you have.</p>

        <p class="lead"><strong>It's a proper 'rags-to-riches' story for our Peanut.</strong> We rescued him when we lived in Malaga, Spain, after he was found in a bin at 2 weeks old. However, since he's joined our little family, he might be one of the most well-travelled dogs in Europe, racking up over 32 border crossings so far...</p>
        <p class="lead">After 5 amazing years living in rural Andalucia, we made the decision to see more of the world, and have been travelling full-time since 2017. Our aim is to visit every country in Europe (just 6 to go!), but our hearts belong to the Balkans, and especially Mostar in the heart of Herzegovina.</p>
        <p class="lead">If we do settle down, we think it'll be rural Mostar, with regular trips to our favourite Indonesian island of Lombok.</p>
